## Reflection

### What I Learned
Throughout this project, I gained practical experience in working with a real-world codebase, collaborating with my team, and contributing to an open-source project. I developed my skills in identifying and resolving bugs, ensuring code quality, and writing comprehensive tests to improve test coverage.

### Challenges and Solutions
One of the main challenges was understanding the existing codebase and integrating the new feature seamlessly. By thoroughly reviewing the code and following best practices, I was able to implement the user profile management feature effectively. The experience has prepared me for real-world development scenarios and improved my problem-solving skills.

### Future Improvements
Moving forward, I aim to further enhance the profile field validation and explore additional functionalities to make the user profile management feature more robust and user-friendly.
